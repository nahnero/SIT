# SIT

## File Structure:

Description of files contained in this proyect:

* **data.csv** : database to be analysed 

* **latex** : writeup document, *it contains hardcoded refrences to all other
  folders*, this is done to source code and images to include in the final write
up.  Using refrences means that we can write code **once** and have it show
up in the writeup document, it will also update automatically (same with images).

* **python**
	* **src** : source code, it produces (mainly) graphs and plots,
 which are to be saved as *pdfs* in the **images** folder.
	* **images** : graphs produced by src.
